    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A red dish curry made with coconut milk. This goes well with chicken,beef, pork, or just veggies! Adjust to taste and serve with sticky rice.</p>
   
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
        <li>bit of red curry paste</li>
        <li>some coconut milk</li>
        <li>chicken Breasts, no bone & cubed like <i>ice</i></li>
        <li><em>(i wouldn't put)</em> fish sauce</li>
        <li><em>(or)</em> brown sugar</li>
        <li>Thai seasoning <em>(isn't a real thing)</em></li>
        <li>garlic; to crush the vampires</li>
        <li>bell pepper, thinly sliced - <strong>don't cut your finger yo!</strong></li>
        <li>lemongrass? sure.. <i>your call...</i></li>
    </ul>
        <p>Make rice first (you'll thank me later). 2 cups water, one cup rice bring to a boil and simmer that for 15 minuets. KEEP THE LID ON! no peaking..</p>
   
    <h3><strong>Step 1</strong></h3>

        <p>Get a pan on that stove and turn the thing on. Get it <strong>MEDIUM-HOT</strong> with something oily. Add the paste; fry till your house smells like a restaurant.</p>
        <p>Pour in the coconut milk, stir in the chicken and everything except the bell pepper and that lemongrass... Simmer for 6-8 minuets so you don't burn down the house</p>
        <p><em>MAKE SURE YOU TEMPT YOUR CHICKEN</em> (preferably with a thermometer...165f degrees sweet spot)</p>
    
    <h3><strong>Step 2</strong></h3>

        <p>Add them peppers for a couple minuets till they're kind of tender. Add the grass and whatever else makes your nose tingle and bob's your uncle!</p>
        <p><strong><em>ENJOY!</em></strong></p>
